For small, low torque motors with little or no gearing, one procedure you can use to get a good baseline tune is to probe it's response to a disturbance.

To tune a PID use the following steps:

    Set all gains to zero.
    Increase the P gain until the response to a disturbance is steady oscillation.
    Increase the D gain until the the oscillations go away (i.e. it's critically damped).
    Repeat steps 2 and 3 until increasing the D gain does not stop the oscillations.
    Set P and D to the last stable values.
    Increase the I gain until it brings you to the setpoint with the number of oscillations desired (normally zero but a quicker response can be had if you don't mind a couple oscillations of overshoot)

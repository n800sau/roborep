robot_upstart does not work correctly

use instead line in rc.local:
su -l -c "roslaunch nanaybot minimal.launch" n800s &

with 
source ${HOME}/work/roborep/ROS/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
export ROS_MASTER_URI=http://192.168.1.9:11311

in .profile

NOT just in .bashrc

for voice commands it needs ros-*-pocketsphinx 

to avoid USB warning for xtion using openni2 add to /etc/security/limits.conf line 

@realtime	hard	rtprio		100

then create group realtime and add the user to that group
and possibly add call to
ulimit -r 10
to .bashrc

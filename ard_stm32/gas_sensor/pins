RST - this is the TFT reset pin. Connect to ground to reset the TFT! Its best to have this pin controlled by the library so the display is reset cleanly, but you can also connect it to the Arduino Reset pin, which works for most cases.

CS - this is the TFT SPI chip select pin

D/C - this is the TFT SPI data or command selector pin

DIN - this is the SPI Master Out Slave In pin (MOSI), it is used to send data from the microcontroller to the SD card and/or TFT

SCLK - this is the SPI clock input pin

Vcc - this is the power pin, connect to 5VDC - it has reverse polarity protection but try to wire it right!

BL - this is the input for the backlight control. Connect to 5VDC to turn on the backlight.

GND - this is the power and signal ground pin
